# Welcome to the heart disease analysis repository

## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on indicators of heart disease. For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

  

1.  Understanding Data
    
2.  Exploratory Data Analysis
    
3.  Decision Tree
    
4.  Random Forest Model
    
5.  XG Boost Model
    

  

We used 3 Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

## Problem Definition

  

* Which indicator is best to predict heart disease?
    
* Which model is the most accurate in this prediction?
    

## Indicators Used

1.  Age
    
2.  Sex
    
3.  Chest Pain Type
    
4.  Resting Blood Pressure
    
5.  Cholesterol
    
6.  Fasting Blood Sugar
    
7.  Max Heart Rate
    
8.  Exercise Angina: Chest Pain during exercise
    

## Models Used

1.  Decision tree
    
2.  Random Forest
    
3.  XGBoost
    

# Conclusion

* We concluded that the Random Forest Algorithm is the best model that can be used to predict the presence of heart disease, given several symptoms associated with heart disease as factors. 
    
* Max heart rate is the best indicator to predict heart disease.
    

## What did we learn from this project?

* Handling imbalanced datasets using resampling methods 
    
* Converting categorical data into numerical data set for training by using dummy data
    
* Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
    
* Logistic Regression from sklearn
    
* API Usage
    
* Collaborating using Google Collab
